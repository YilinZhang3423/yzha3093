 A2: 

üñ•Ô∏èDesktop:

The original music player was embedded in the right-top corner of every page. It would always show the playlist (next song to play) below the play music section.

üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏èFeedback from user:

1. Playlists choice:
Although most of the user usually plays their liked playlist, many of them do try some trending or recommend playlist from time to time. So I choose five trending playlist that suits for motivating students from spotify.

2. Embed music player on the page:
Users find that it‚Äôs troublesome to have the next several songs to play below the music player on the right top corner. So I decide to only keep the play music section on the right-top corner of each page.

‚ú®A3:

I added a music seletct parts in the dashboard.
