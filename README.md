üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏èFeedback from user:

1.Playlists choice:
Although most of the user usually plays their liked playlist, many of them do try some trending or recommend playlist from time to time. So I choose five trending playlist that suits for motivating students from spotify.

2.Embed music player on the page:
Users find that it‚Äôs troublesome to have the next several songs to play below the music player on the right top corner. So I decide to only keep the play music section on the right-top corner of each page.

I added a music seletct parts in the dashboard.
